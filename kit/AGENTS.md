# Working on recomp-kit

Read README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md and docs/code-guide.md before a broad change.
This repository contains the native runtime and translator. Game files and
translations are private local inputs under ignored original/, analysis/ and build/.

- Keep changes focused; preserve unrelated local work and player profiles.
- Comment major functions and unusual guest layout, timing or ownership rules.
- Never replace 32-bit guest addresses with host pointers. Respect the cooperative
  scheduler baton and the immutable frame boundary described in docs/architecture.md.
- Edit translation rules, not build/recomp/gen/. Regenerate after changing the translator.
- Format first-party native source with `.venv/bin/python tools/format.py --write`.
  Preserve vendored code and its notices.
- Run relevant suites from docs/testing.md; native code builds only through
  tools/build.py and tools/test.py, never by invoking compilers directly.
  Platform calls go through platform/os.h; no `#ifdef` on the platform
  outside os_posix.cpp and os_win32.cpp. Report exactly which checks ran;
  compilation and offscreen counters do not establish playable performance.
- Every game-specific literal belongs in `games/<id>/`; run `tools/check_game_literals.py`
  before committing native code.
- Do not commit game assets, generated code, binaries, credentials, personal saves
  or run logs. Run `.venv/bin/python tools/check_repo.py` on staged source changes.
- Keep setup/build instructions reproducible from a clean checkout. Update the
  changelog for user-visible behavior and preserve the single Graphics resolution control.

## Authoritative workspace

Before writes, read [../../../WORKSPACE.md](../../../WORKSPACE.md) and resolve its physical workspace root.
Use this existing game/kit working set; preserve their Git/submodule relationship.
Keep new project outputs and experiments under the workspace's existing folders.
Do not create a separate editable source copy for a new conversation. Current
progress belongs in workspace RESUME_NATIVE.md and the existing release matrix.
