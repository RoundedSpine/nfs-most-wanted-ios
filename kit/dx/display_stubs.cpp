// signature can: a status returns the failure, a pointer returns null, a count
// returns zero. None of them pretends to succeed, because a stub that answered
// plausibly would let a caller be written against behaviour that does not
// exist yet and look correct until the day it is replaced.
//
// A later task deletes the stubs it implements from this file. When the file
// is empty the interface is done.
