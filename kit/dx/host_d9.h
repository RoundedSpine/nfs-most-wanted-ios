// host_d9.h - the Direct3D 9 device's GPU renderer, as the shim calls it.
//
// The shim keeps every resource's bytes in its own storage and decides what
// the GPU needs to hear. The host mirrors textures, surfaces and buffers under
// the shim's object ids and draws what it is told. A texture id names the
// whole texture; a surface of a texture is (texture id, face, level). A
// stand-alone surface - the back buffer, a depth-stencil surface - is a
// one-level texture under its own id.
//
// Weak no-op defaults live in host_d9_default.cpp; host_d9_active() returning
// zero there is what keeps the CPU renderer in charge.
